    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* A white noise model has a fixed and constant mean and variance, and no correlation over time  \n",
    "* A random walk model has no specified mean or variance, but has a strong dependence over time  \n",
    "* The Pandas `.corr()` method can be used to return the correlation between various time series in the DataFrame  \n",
    "* Autocorrelation allows us to identify how strongly each time series observation is related to previous observations  \n",
    "* The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) is a function that represents autocorrelation of a time series as a function of the time lag  \n",
    "* The Partial Autocorrelation Function (or PACF) gives the partial correlation of a time series with its own lagged values, controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags  \n",
    "* ARMA (Autoregressive and Moving Average) modeling is a tool for forecasting time series values by regressing the variable on its own lagged (past) values  \n",
    "* ARMA models assume that you've already detrended your data and that there is no seasonality \n",
